# CHIP690-297-Spring2025 Project

This is my CHIP-690-297-Spring2025 project. It dispalys diabetes diagnostic test results for a specific patient. Patients with diabetes or prediabetes were selected using a sample (non-exhaustive) list of SNOMED CT codes. Test results were obtained using LOINC codes. The display uses HighCharts.

## How to use:
1. Open in a web browser ([](https://violagoodacre.github.io/chip690-project/)).
2. 

I have included a launch.html for launching in SmartHealthIT, but there is no need to do this because the webpage is stand-alone. If you want to view it in SmartHealthIT, you can do so by going toenter the URL of your '...launch.html' page in the smarthealthit launch form and click "Launch".

For example, my URL is [](https://violagoodacre.github.io/chip690-project/launch.html)
   
speciallows the user to select from a list of patients with sample diabetes and pre-diabetes SNOMED CT codes.

It uses Jon Tweedy's Smart on FHIR demo repo (https://github.com/jetweedy/smart_on_fhir) for code to launch
